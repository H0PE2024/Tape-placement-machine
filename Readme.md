**MECHANICAL DESIGN INTERN 2019**
This PDF showcases the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing **(GDT)** drawings for the components I designed during my Mechanical Design internship in 2019. Using **SolidWorks**, I developed and iterated these designs based on **Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA)** principles ensuring manufacturability in shorter times and cheaper rates.
